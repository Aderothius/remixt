# TODO for demix

## General

* Rename

## Benchmarking

* Use real data (in seqdata format) to generate simulated genomes with real reads

## Refactor

* Rank solutions by BIC or similar to discern solutions with different numbers of clones
* Output all solutions in some easy to navigate directory structure

## Algorithm

* Learn parameters based on large amounts of real data
* Revisit parameter settings
* Mixing proportion output as DNA proportion and also cell proportion
